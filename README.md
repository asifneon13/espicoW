# espicoW - WiFi Library for Chinese Pico W Boards

A comprehensive MicroPython WiFi library for Chinese Raspberry Pi Pico W clones that use the ESP8285 chip instead of the standard CYW43439 WiFi chip.

## Acknowledgments

This library builds upon the foundational work of **[mocacinno](https://github.com/mocacinno/rp2040_with_esp8285)**, who first demonstrated how to make WiFi functionality work on Chinese Pico W boards with ESP8285 chips. Their initial implementation and documentation provided the essential groundwork that made this enhanced library possible.

We also acknowledge the inspiration drawn from **[JiriBilek's ESP_ATMod firmware](https://github.com/JiriBilek/ESP_ATMod)** and the **[WiFiEspAT Arduino library](https://github.com/JAndrassy/WiFiEspAT)**.

## Background

Many Chinese Raspberry Pi Pico W clones use the ESP8285 WiFi chip instead of the standard Broadcom CYW43439. These boards are often significantly cheaper but require different WiFi libraries since the standard Pico W WiFi libraries don't work with ESP8285 hardware.

## Features

## Hardware Requirements

### Supported Boards
- Chinese Raspberry Pi Pico W clones with ESP8285 WiFi chip
- RP2040 + ESP8285 combination boards
- Any RP2040 board with external ESP8285 module

### Connections
The library expects the ESP8285 to be connected via UART0:
- **ESP8285 TX** → **Pico GP1 (UART0 RX)**
- **ESP8285 RX** → **Pico GP0 (UART0 TX)**
- **ESP8285 VCC** → **3.3V**
- **ESP8285 GND** → **Ground**

## Installation

1. **Flash ESP8285 with AT Firmware** (if needed):
   - Use the Serial_port_transmission.uf2 method as described in mocacinno's guide
   - Flash with standard AT firmware or ESP_ATMod for better TLS support

2. **Install MicroPython on Pico**:
   - Use standard Pico firmware (not Pico W firmware)
   - Copy `espicoW.py` to your MicroPython device

## Quick Start

### Basic WiFi Connection
```python
import espicoW

# Initialize and connect
espicoW.init()
status = espicoW.begin("YourWiFi", "YourPassword")

if status == espicoW.WL_CONNECTED:
    print(f"Connected! IP: {espicoW.local_ip()}")
    print(f"Gateway: {espicoW.gateway_ip()}")
    print(f"Signal: {espicoW.rssi()} dBm")
```

### HTTP Client
```python
# Create and use HTTP client
client = espicoW.Client()

if client.connect("httpbin.org", 80):
    # Send HTTP request
    client.print("GET /get HTTP/1.1\r\n")
    client.print("Host: httpbin.org\r\n")
    client.print("Connection: close\r\n\r\n")
    client.flush()
    
    # Read response
    while client.available():
        data = client.readBuf(1024)
        print(data.decode())
    
    client.stop()
```

### HTTPS Client
```python
# Create SSL client
client = espicoW.Client()

if client.connectSSL("api.github.com", 443):
    client.print("GET /user HTTP/1.1\r\n")
    client.print("Host: api.github.com\r\n")
    client.print("User-Agent: espicoW/1.0\r\n")
    client.print("Connection: close\r\n\r\n")
    client.flush()
    
    # Handle response...
    client.stop()
```

    print(f"Connection failed: {error_msg}")
```

## Known Limitations

### SSL/TLS Support
- SSL support depends on ESP8285 AT firmware version
- Some servers may not work due to cipher compatibility
- Consider using HTTP where possible for maximum compatibility

### Concurrent Connections
- Maximum 5 simultaneous connections (ESP8285 hardware limit)
- Link IDs are managed automatically

### Memory Constraints
- Large HTTP responses may cause memory issues on RP2040
- Use streaming reads for large data transfers
- Regular garbage collection recommended

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**WiFi Connection Fails:**
- Check SSID and password
- Verify ESP8285 is in station mode (library handles this automatically)
- Check UART connections and baud rate

**SSL Connections Don't Work:**
- Try HTTP instead of HTTPS
- Update ESP8285 AT firmware to ESP_ATMod
- Some servers require SNI or specific TLS versions

**Memory Errors:**
- Use smaller buffer sizes
- Call `gc.collect()` periodically
- Avoid keeping large responses in memory

### Debug Logging
Enable debug output by modifying the library:
```python
# In espicoW.py, change:
LOG_DEBUG = True
```

## Examples

Complete examples are available:
- **Weather Station**: Fetch weather data from APIs
- **Gas Sensor Monitor**: Web-based air quality monitoring
- **IoT Data Logger**: Send sensor data to cloud services

## Library Architecture

### Unified Design
Unlike the original separate WiFi2.py and EspAtDrv2.py files, espicoW combines all functionality into a single, cohesive module:

- **Reduced complexity**: Single import, unified API
- **Better error handling**: Consistent error reporting across all functions
- **Memory efficiency**: Eliminated duplicate code and circular imports
- **Maintainability**: Single file to update and maintain

### AT Command Layer
The library includes a full AT command implementation:
- Automatic command retry and error recovery
- Extended timeouts for reliable communication
- Response parsing and validation
- Link management and monitoring

## Performance

### Typical Performance Metrics
- **WiFi Connection Time**: 3-8 seconds depending on network
- **HTTP Request**: 200-500ms for small requests
- **HTTPS Request**: 1-3 seconds (firmware dependent)
- **Memory Usage**: ~15KB baseline, ~5-10KB per active connection

### Optimization Tips
- Reuse client objects when possible
- Close connections promptly after use
- Use appropriate buffer sizes for your data
- Enable only necessary logging levels
